# Bridge Pattern
Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation, which can be developed independently of each other.

# When to use
- When we have N type of Classes that can have M type of implements
- If we use inheritance, then total number of class we need to create N*M. But bridge design pattern reduce the creation of classes to N+M.
