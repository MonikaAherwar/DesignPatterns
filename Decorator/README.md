# Decorator Pattern
It attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible atlernative to subclasses for extending functionality.

# When to use
- When we want to avoid creating multiple small subclasses for adding bare funtionalities. Add a wrapper on top a class object and change the IS-A (Inheritance) relationships with HAS-A (Interfaces).
- When we have a posibility of large number of subclasses for a given class.
- When we want to avoid violating Open Close Principle. This pattern ensures it.

# Example
- Vending Machine
