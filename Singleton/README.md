# Singleton Pattern
Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

# When to use
- When we want single instance for a class througout the code.
- When we don't want to re-instantiate the object for a class. For this we mark the constructor as private.
- It is not recommended to use this pattern much as it produces code smell.
